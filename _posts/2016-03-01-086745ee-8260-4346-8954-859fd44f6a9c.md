What about text only?

I am a west coast transplant now calling Boston home. After graduating from Berklee I didn't want to follow my peers and move away from the city I love. I like to be in front of the mic performing or at front of house mixing. Either way I want to be right where the music is. I also run an all-ages open mic at Brandy Pete's on Saturday nights.
